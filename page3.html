        14km away from the border with Guatemala, you can find a living image of the indigenous past of Honduras conserved to perfection. The ruins of Copan are the most priceless remains of the Mayan civilization because they were once the most important city in the kingdom. The complex was built between 400 AD to 800 AD only being discovered by the Spanish in 1570. Copan was the capital of the Mayan Kingdom since its completion and it continued with that status for many years. Historians say that that city was used for ceremonial occasions and the stone ruins weren’t houses for commoners but instead were for the high class of the Mayan society. It is not clear why, but the city was abandoned at the beginning of the 9th century AD. However, it is likely that this was thanks to political turmoil and war with rival tribes. Copan is important to Honduras because it is the country’s most famous tourist attraction. Around 150,000 travel to Honduras, each year just to visit this UNESCO heritage site. It is an important attraction that works as Marketing for Honduran tourism and benefits hundreds of local businesses and guides that offer their services to tourists who want to go to Copan. At Copan, you can take the time to look at ancient Mayan architecture and inscriptions. Tours and private guides can teach you all about the history of the city and fun facts that only Honduran locals know about. The ancient city will leave you with a wonderful perspective of just how educated and intelligent the Mayas were. In fact, Copan wouldn’t simply make the Top 10 list of Honduras but it probably would also make the Top 10 list of Central America as well. In general, the Copan ruins offer information and a memorable experience for travelers of all types and people of all ages. Make sure to go there on your next trip to Honduras!

        Did you know Honduras has a unique species? Its name is the Honduran emerald. It is found in the arid interior valleys of northern and central Honduras. The Honduran emerald is a species of hummingbird that is in danger of going extinct. This hummingbird is full of vibrant colors and it's a beautiful, unique animal. 90% of this species has been lost because of agriculture and degradation. The Honduran emerald uses its long straw-like tongues to be able to drink the nectar of the flower. This hummingbird is able to lick 13 times per second. They usually eat many kinds of different flowers, like the Pedilanthus camporum and the Nopalea hondurensis. They also eat from hummingbird feeders and take some small spiders and insects, which is a very high protein source for the Honduran emerald. A nesting female can capture at least 2,000 insects a day. The Honduran emerald is unique and can only be found in Honduras. The Honduran emerald has a very high possibility of going extinct and this is creating a lot of concern for Hondurans if this species disappears completely in Honduras it will not be found in any other part of the world. If you ever go to Honduras and have the opportunity to see a Honduran emerald, try to be careful and don't get near them or try to make any harm to them don’t give them food or try to touch them we have to protect the Honduran emerald because if we don't, no one will be able to see this specie ever again.

        Everyone has always been afraid of the myth of bats being dark and blood sucking  animals, but this tiny and cute bat discards the idea. In the southern regions of Honduras, the Honduran fruit bat is found. It can also be found in El Salvador and northwest Nicaragua. This bat measures 4 centimeters. They have white hair, and they only eat fruits and vegetables. This animal was found in the eastern jungles of Honduras. Their white fur gives them the ability to reflect the green light that filters through the banana leaf. This way, they hide in groups, among the leaves, and protect themselves from predators that can attack from the ground. Usually, this species only gives birth to one baby. That's why they are in danger of being in a state of extinction. Like the Honduran emerald, the Honduran fruit bat was found in Honduras, and even if the Honduran fruit bat is found in other parts of the world, it's very important to Honduras because it's native there. What tourists can do to protect this species is to be careful when they see banana leaves because that's where they hide. Also, be careful and don’t step on them because there are only a few of these species left and we have to take care of them if we are going to lose them forever.

    <p  class="paragraph2">
        The Caratasca lagoon, also known as the Lagoon of the Lizards, is a large freshwater lagoon in the department of Gracias a Dios in the northeast of the country. The town of Puerto Lempira, the capital of the department, is located on its shore. The Caratasca lagoon extends from the Caribbean Sea for approximately 40 kilometers. In reality, the lagoon is made up of many lagoons connected by natural channels. The largest island in the lagoon is Tamsin Island. Its west coast is part of a biological reserve. To the south and east of this lagoon are the Warunta, Tansin, and Tilbalaca lagoons, and their waters are fresh as they are fed by the Warunta, Moroccan, or Ibantara rivers and the Cauquira and Cohunta lagoons. Where this lagoon is located, its surroundings are full of mountains and valleys covered by beautiful forests full of great natural wealth. This lagoon is important to Honduras because it brings tourists to come to visit this beautiful, full-of-nature lagoon. It also helps the country's economy because of the fishing that happens in this lagoon. If you ever come to visit Honduras and come to the Caratasca lagoon, you should be very conscious of every animal that lives inside and outside of the lagoon and how you would like to see it without any garbage and full of color. So I recommend you don’t throw trash and waste into the lagoon and also try not to give any food to the animals. We need to try to conserve this beautiful lagoon and protect it.

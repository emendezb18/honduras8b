<h2 class="footer">Indigenous Civilizations 12,000 BC to 200 AD</h2>

12000 years before Christ, people used central America as a bridge to cross from North to South America. For thousands of years, Honduras was home to many tribes and one of them prevailed: The Mayas. This civilization imposed its rule and used its knowledge to bring peace and prosperity to Honduras by building cities and important archaeological sites like Copan city. The Mayas set the building blocks for Honduras to develop slowly over the years by teaching primitive tribes and helping the country by using their advanced technology. The Mayas had an organized social structure in which royalty lived in glamorous palaces made of stone, and commoners lived in mud or stone huts on the outskirts of the city. Mayas loved entertainment with music and dances being present almost everywhere in their cities. Ball games were played competitively with 2 teams trying to get the ball through hoops using only their elbows and hips. As a fun fact, Mayas would sometimes sacrifice the losing team to the gods because they were very religious and grateful.

The Spanish discovered Honduras during Columbus’s last trip through the Americas. Things started pretty rough if we consider that Columbus left 2 people in charge of Honduras, Gil Gonzalez Davila and Cristobal De Olid. These 2 men only sought power and didn’t care about the indigenous population of the country. They looted villages, raped women, and executed those who opposed themselves. This power-seeking attitude caused the colony to descend into chaos, and it was almost abandoned. The situation was so critical that the tribes united under a chief known as Lempira, they led an organized resistance against the Spanish and caused heavy losses to their forces that were already fighting amongst themselves. Eventually, the Conquistador Hernan Cortes decided to bring his forces from Mexico down to Honduras to calm the situation down. The indigenous population suffered even more as there were now 3 different Spanish generals each trying to take Honduras and its resources for themselves. Raping, looting, and torture increased exponentially and only decreased when Cortes gained control of the country and started seeking peace between the Spanish and the natives.

Honduras didn’t break free from Spain alone but instead decided to join forces with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua to defeat the Spanish rulers. During the start of the 19th century, the first revolt started in El Salvador with a mixed force of natives and slave descendants starting to organize attacks against Spanish authorities. Despite these brave attempts to start a revolution, the Spanish managed to destroy the insurgent movement and all thoughts of freedom were abandoned for some years. In 1808, Napoleon's takeover of Spain created a breakout of rebels all across Spanish America, creating weakness for Spain and the probability of having to leave Honduras. Honduras needed more power to be able to defeat Spain and be able to become independent, so Honduras united forces with other Central American countries and fought together, finally succeeding and becoming independent in 1821. In 1823, Mexico started a revolution. The Mexican Congress voted to allow Central American countries to decide what they wanted to do. Honduras and other Central American countries decided to join Mexico's revolution. Honduras adopted the new name "state" after the revolution ended. Honduras had never been in the power of a president before, and for the first time in history, Honduras elected its first president, Dionisio de Herrera, in 1824, with José Justo Milla as his vice head of state.

The Federal Republic of Central America faced many problems since its creation in 1823. For starters, every country in the republic had its own opinion about how the government should take decisions. The main groups were the liberals and conservatives who each wanted to have their grip over the Republic. The Catholic church played a big part because the conservatives wanted the church to hold political positions and be the most powerful organization in the country. However, after the liberals won the elections in 1825, they held on to power and started limiting the church’s privileges. Tensions increased until 1837 when Cholera outbreaks in different parts of the country caused the tension to reach a breaking point with each side accusing the other of not doing enough to control the disease. Eventually, wealthy conservatives started handing out money to rebel groups in order to start a civil war. After seeing this, in 1838 high-ranking officials in Honduras decided that the Republic would bring more problems than prosperity and decided it would be better to leave the Republic. Finally, Honduras was free and independent from Europeans and Central Americans. It was a new start for the country and its people.
